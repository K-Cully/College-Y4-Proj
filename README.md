# SticKart

SticKart is a 2D side-scrolling platformer which I created as my major final year college project.
It utilizes the Kinect sensor for input and the target platform is Windows 7.
The objective of the game is to run, jump and crouch your way to the top of the high score tables.
All player actions control the actions of the stick man and the cart can be used to give your legs a rest or to avoid obstacles on the platforms.

The main features of the game are:
1. Motion control using a gesture managment system which automatically recalibrates to suit each individual player's body dimensions.
2. A bespoke player tracking system which filters the active player from the recognised skeletons.
3. Voice control.
4. A fully fledged NUI level editor.
5. A bespoke NUI friendly menu system.
6. A thread safe notification manager 
7. Local and online leaderboards (Online leaderboards are no longer active as my Azure subscription ran out).

The project is built using the following technologies:
1. XNA
2. Farseer Physics
3. Kinect for Windows SDK v1.6
4. Microsoft Speech platform
5. Windows Communication Foundation
6. Windows Azure
7. IIS
8. SQL

I have not copied any of the web service components to this repository (just in case you were looking for them).
